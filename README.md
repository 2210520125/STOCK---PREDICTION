# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the **Stock Price Prediction** project!  
This repository combines **sentiment analysis** and **machine learning** to forecast stock prices based on news sentiment and historical data. It's an integration of **data science**, **NLP**, and **financial analytics** — ideal for real-world financial modeling applications.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that:
- Analyzes sentiment from financial news articles.
- Uses historical stock data.
- Applies machine learning to forecast stock trends.

---

## 💡 Key Highlights

- 📊 **Stock Data Analysis** (Apple & Google)
- 📰 **Sentiment Analysis** using NLTK's VADER
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** for price prediction
- 🧪 Combines fundamental (news) and technical (stock price) indicators

## 📦 Installation

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2210520125/STOCK---PREDICTION.git
cd Stock-Price-Prediction-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```

And download NLTK resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

```bash
python Code.py
```

The script performs:
1. Sentiment analysis on Apple news data.
2. Combines it with stock prices.
3. Applies ML models to predict future trends.

---

## 🔍 How It Works (Workflow)

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean stock + news datasets.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use `VADER` to score headlines (positive/negative/neutral).
3. **Merge Datasets**:
   - Combine sentiment scores with stock price history.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Train regression models to predict stock prices based on sentiment + historical data.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Plot and analyze model performance.
